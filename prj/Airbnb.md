## About

This was one of the more normal R projects that I have worked on. While there was a large amount of data and it required a large amount of cleaning.This group worked very well together and we came up with some pretty interesting conclusions as a team. The most difficult part of this project was dealing with the very large dataset and compute times.

I am most proud of the maps I created, as the location data could be used by the SF package in R to produce some beautiful visualizations. I had never used that package or had done too much locational data in a while, so it was fun to explore and try things out.
