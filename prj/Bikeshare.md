## About

THis project was a quick and fun investigation into the usage of bikeshare bikes around Washington DC. Having used one of these the previous summer, I was glad to have found this dataset and been able to use it for this course's final project. I rode one of these bikeshare bikes from the Lincoln memorial to the metro stop at Arlington Cemetary to catch the train back to where I was staying. While riding downhill on a perfect 75Â°F sunny day, I could also imagine how difficult going uphill on a hot, humid day could be on these heavy bikes.

I am most proud of the neural network I trained which was one of the higher performing models we created. It was fun to train and test out different variations and shapes of the neural layers. If I had more computing power and more time, I am sure I could have improved it even further, but I am still happy with how it turned out.
