## About

This was one of my first projects using multiple linear regression and the Cox proportional hazards model on a large dataset. I chose this data on animal adoptions because I had just adopted my first cat, Gizmo, and was planning to adopt my second, Jiji. During Gizmo's adoption process, I did not do much research on the other available cats, as the shelter had recommended him as a good first cat. When I was looking into adopting a second cat, however, there were an overwhelming amount of available cats posted online by local shelters that I found myself researching a potential cats' age, breed, and many other factors. This made me wonder how these many factors might impact how long an animal would be in the shelter until it was adopted.

I am proud of this report because of the personal connection I had while investigating the dataset. I learned a lot about data cleaning and modeling in R. The proportional hazards visualizations also look very nice, so I am proud of my improving visualization skills.
