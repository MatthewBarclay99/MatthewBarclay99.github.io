## About

I had fun analyzing this dataset because it was already cleaned and I was able to explore new prediction methods. While I had previously used multiple linear regression in other school projects, this was the first time I have used the K-nearest neighbors models as well as my first time using cross-validation.

I am most proud of my visualization function, which greatly simplified the task of creating multiple ggplots for each variable. This was also my first project in R since undergrad, so I was glad to remember my R skills and improve on them.
