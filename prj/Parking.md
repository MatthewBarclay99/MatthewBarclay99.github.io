## About

The goal of this project was to visualize and draw conclusions from a public dataset with over 1 million observations. My group took this requirement to the next level, finding this dataset with over 8.5 million observations. I was working on this group project as the COVID-19 pandemic shut the university down, so I had a lot of extra time on my hands to explore fun new visualizations. Additionally, this was the first project where I utilized git to collaborate with my group, especially with the pandemic separating us across the country from each other.

Dealing with such a massive dataset, the quirky location data format, and learning git all at the same time made this project the most difficult one I have worked on yet, but also the most rewarding. I felt like completing this project laid the foundation for my confidence in using R.

I am most proud of the interactive heatmap, as I taught myself how to access the Mapbox API, embed the app in the HTML output, and convert the location data. (It also looks really cool)
