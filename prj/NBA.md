## About

This was my first class utilizing Julia for data analysis and it became very natural to use immediately. It reminded me of Python while having unique syntax and allowing for intuitive analysis techniques. While this course is normally taught in Python, I am glad that I was able to expand my coding experience with Julia, as I have experience with Python already.

I am most proud of my 3D visualization of the PCA graph. Using Plotly.JS, I was able to make the usually static 3D PCA graph into an interactive and movable object. This made visually identifying differences and groupings a lot easier.
